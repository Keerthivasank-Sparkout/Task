1.What is Browser?
    > The web browser is an application software used to explore the World Wide Web (WWW). 
    > It acts as a platform that allows users to access information from the Internet by serving as an interface between the client (user) and the server. 
    > The browser sends requests to servers for web documents and services, then renders the received HTML content, including text, images, links, styles, and scripts.

2.What is HTTP?
    >HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a core Internet protocol that defines how data is exchanged between clients and servers on the web.
    >Enables communication between web browsers and web servers.
    >Forms the foundation of data transfer on the World Wide Web.
    >Defines rules for requesting and delivering data between systems.

3.what is session?
    > A session is a way for a web server to remember information about a user between requests by storing data on the server and associating it with a unique session ID sent to the client, usually through a cookie.

4.What is cookies?
    > A cookie is a small piece of data stored in the user's browser by a website to remember information about the user across multiple HTTP requests.

5.Why cookie are important?
    >Why Cookies Are Needed?
    >Because HTTP is stateless — the server forgets you after every request.
        So cookies help store things like:
            .Login session ID
            .User preferences
            .Language settings
            .Cart items

6.What is Local storage?
    >Local Storage is a web browser storage mechanism that allows websites to store data in the user's browser permanently (until manually cleared).
    >It is part of the Web Storage API.
    >Key Features
        .Stores data in key–value pairs
        .Data stays even after browser refresh
        .Data stays even after closing browser
        .Only accessible using JavaScript
        .Not automatically sent to server

7.What is JSON?
    >JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based, and language-independent data-interchange format designed to be easily read by humans and parsed by machines. 
     It is widely used for transmitting data between servers and web applications. JSON is structured using key-value pairs (objects) and ordered lists (arrays), offering a flexible alternative to XML.
8.what is JSON Serialization?
    >JSON serialization means converting an object into a JSON string so it can be sent over the internet or stored.
    >Since HTTP can only send data in text format, we cannot send objects directly. So we convert the object into a JSON string. This process is called serialization.
    >In JavaScript, we use:
    >JSON.stringify() → to convert an object into a JSON string.
    >The reverse process is called deserialization, where we convert the JSON string back into an object.
    >In JavaScript, we use:
        >JSON.parse() → to convert a JSON string back into an object.
        >JSON serialization is commonly used when sending data between frontend and backend through APIs.

9.What is Encryption and Decryption?
    >Encryption is the process of converting plain text into ciphertext to protect data
     from unauthorized access. Decryption is the reverse process of converting
     ciphertext back into plain text.
        How to secure the data:
            >Symmetric Key Encryption:
                .The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
                .Examples: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard).
                .Note: The key must be shared securely before communication.
            >Asymmetric Key Encryption:
                .A pair of keys is used: Public Key and Private Key.
                .Public Key is used for encryption, and Private Key is used for decryption (or vice versa).
                .Examples: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).

10.What is Hashing?
    >Hashing is the process of converting data (like a password) into a fixed-length string using a mathematical algorithm.
    >The output is called a hash value or digest.
        >Important:
            .Hashing is one-way.
            .You cannot reverse it back to the original data.

11.what is Authentication and Authourization?
    >Authentication (Who are you?)
        .Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.
            Example:
                .Login with username & password
                .OTP verification
                .Biometric (fingerprint)
                .Face ID
        .If credentials are correct → user is authenticated.
    >Authorization (What are you allowed to do?)
        .Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources an authenticated user is allowed to access.
            Example:
                .Admin can delete users
                .Student can view courses
                .Teacher can upload materials

12.What is Session-Based Authentication?
    Session-based authentication is a stateful authentication technique where we use sessions to keep track of the authenticated user. Here is how Session Based Authentication works:
        > User submits the login request for authentication.
        > Server validates the credentials. If the credentials are valid, the server initiates a session and stores some information about the client. This information can be stored in memory, file system, or database. 
           The server also generates a unique identifier that it can later use to retrieve this session information from the storage. Server sends this unique session identifier to the client.
        > Client saves the session id in a cookie and this cookie is sent to the server in each request made after the authentication.
        > Server, upon receiving a request, checks if the session id is present in the request and uses this session id to get information about the client.

13.What is JWT-Based Authentication?
    JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication is a stateless authentication technique where the server does not store session data. Instead, authentication information is stored inside a signed token that is sent to the client.
    Here is how JWT Based Authentication works:
        > User submits the login request for authentication.
        > Server validates the credentials. If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT token. \
        > This token contains encoded information about the user (like user id, role, etc.). 
        > The token is digitally signed using a secret key (or private key).
        > Server sends this JWT token back to the client.
        > Client saves the JWT (usually in localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies).
        > This token is sent in the Authorization header (Bearer Token) in every request after authentication.
        > Server, upon receiving a request, extracts the JWT from the header and verifies its signature using the secret key. If the token is valid and not expired, the server allows access to the requested resource.
        > And that is how JWT-based authentication works.
