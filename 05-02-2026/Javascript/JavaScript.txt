1.what is shallow copy?
    A shallow copy copies only the first level of an object, while nested objects remain shared by reference.
2.what is deep copy?
    A deep copy creates a fully independent copy of an object, including all nested objects, so changes in the copied object do not affect the original.
3.what is hoisting?
    Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope during the creation phase before code execution.

    | Keyword / Type               | Hoisted  | Accessible Before Initialization | What Happens Internally                       |
    +------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
    | var                          | Yes      | Yes (undefined)                  | Declared and initialized with undefined       |
    | let                          | Yes      | No (ReferenceError - TDZ)        | Declared but not initialized (TDZ applies)    |
    | const                        | Yes      | No (ReferenceError - TDZ)        | Declared but not initialized (TDZ applies)    |
    | Function Declaration         | Yes      | Yes                              | Entire function is hoisted                    |
    | Function Expression (var)    | Yes      | No (TypeError)                   | Variable hoisted as undefined                 |
    | Arrow Function (var)         | Yes      | No (TypeError)                   | Variable hoisted as undefined                 |
    +------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
        The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is the period between the hoisting of a let or const variable and its initialization, during which accessing the variable results in a ReferenceError.
