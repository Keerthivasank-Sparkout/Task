what is MongoDb?
    MongoDB is a document database with scalability and fexibility that you can want with the query and indexing that you need.
key feature of mongo db:
    document based: mongo db store data in documents(fields-value pair data structure,NoSql)
    scalable: Very easy to distribute the data across multiple machine as your users and amout of data grow.
    Flexible: No document data schema required so each document can have different number and type of fiels.
    Preformance: Embeded data model,indexing,sharding,Flexible document,native duplication etc.
what is mongoose?
    Mongoose is an object Data modeling(ODM) library for MongoDB and Node Js, a higher level of abstraction.
    Mongoose allow for rapid and simple development of mongoDB database interaction.
    Feature: Schema to model data and relationships,easy data validation,simple query API,middleware,etc
    Mongoose schema: where we made our data by describing the structure of the data defult value and vlidation.
    Mongoose model: A wrapper for the schema providing an interface to the database for crud operation.
create simple model:
    const tourSchema = new mongoose.schema({
        name:{
            type:String,
            required:[true,"the tour name must be required"],
            unique:true
        },
        rating:{
            type:Number,
            default:4.5
        },
        price:{
            type:Number,
            required:[true,"The tour price must requird"]
        }
    })
    const Tour = mongoose.model('Tour',tourSchema);
    //this is used to create db structure and validation
create documents:
    const newTour=new Tour({ // this is used to give data to collection
        name:"the forest hiker",
        rating:4.7,
        price:540
    })

    Tour.save().then(doc=>{  //.save() method is used to store the data in db.
        console.log(doc)
    }).catch(err=>{
        console.log(err)
    })
