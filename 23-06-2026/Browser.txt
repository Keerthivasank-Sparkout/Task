1.What is Browser?
    > The web browser is an application software used to explore the World Wide Web (WWW). 
    > It acts as a platform that allows users to access information from the Internet by serving as an interface between the client (user) and the server. 
    > The browser sends requests to servers for web documents and services, then renders the received HTML content, including text, images, links, styles, and scripts.

2.What is HTTP?
    >HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a core Internet protocol that defines how data is exchanged between clients and servers on the web.
    >Enables communication between web browsers and web servers.
    >Forms the foundation of data transfer on the World Wide Web.
    >Defines rules for requesting and delivering data between systems.

3.what is session?
    > A session is a way for a web server to remember information about a user between requests by storing data on the server and associating it with a unique session ID sent to the client, usually through a cookie.

4.What is cookies?
    > A cookie is a small piece of data stored in the user's browser by a website to remember information about the user across multiple HTTP requests.

5.Why cookie are important?
    >Why Cookies Are Needed?
    >Because HTTP is stateless — the server forgets you after every request.
        So cookies help store things like:
            .Login session ID
            .User preferences
            .Language settings
            .Cart items

6.What is Local storage?
    >Local Storage is a web browser storage mechanism that allows websites to store data in the user's browser permanently (until manually cleared).
    >It is part of the Web Storage API.
    >Key Features
        .Stores data in key–value pairs
        .Data stays even after browser refresh
        .Data stays even after closing browser
        .Only accessible using JavaScript
        .Not automatically sent to server

7.What is JSON?
    >JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based data format used to store and exchange structured data between systems, especially between a client and a server in web applications. 
     It represents data using key–value pairs and arrays, making it easy for humans to read and write, and simple for machines to parse and generate. 
     Although it is derived from JavaScript object syntax, JSON is language-independent and can be used with many programming languages such as Java, Python, C#, and Node.js.
     In web development, JSON is commonly used in APIs to send and receive data over HTTP because it is compact, efficient, and widely supported.

8.what is JSON Serialization?
    >JSON serialization is the process of converting a programming object (like a JavaScript object) into a JSON-formatted string so that it can be stored or transmitted over a network. 
     Since data sent through HTTP must be in text format, objects cannot be sent directly; they must first be converted into a JSON string. 
     This conversion is called serialization. For example, in JavaScript, the `JSON.stringify()` method is used to serialize an object into a JSON string. 
     The opposite process, called deserialization, converts the JSON string back into a usable object using `JSON.parse()`. 
     JSON serialization is commonly used in web applications when sending data between the frontend and backend through APIs.

9.What is Encryption and Decryption?
    >Encryption is the process of converting plain text into ciphertext to protect data
     from unauthorized access. Decryption is the reverse process of converting
     ciphertext back into plain text.
        How to secure the data:
            >Symmetric Key Encryption:
                .The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
                .Examples: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard).
                .Note: The key must be shared securely before communication.
            >Asymmetric Key Encryption:
                .A pair of keys is used: Public Key and Private Key.
                .Public Key is used for encryption, and Private Key is used for decryption (or vice versa).
                .Examples: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).

10.What is Hashing?
    >Hashing is the process of converting data (like a password) into a fixed-length string using a mathematical algorithm.
    >The output is called a hash value or digest.
        >Important:
            .Hashing is one-way.
            .You cannot reverse it back to the original data.

11.what is Authentication and Authourization?
    >Authentication (Who are you?)
        .Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.
            Example:
                .Login with username & password
                .OTP verification
                .Biometric (fingerprint)
                .Face ID
        .If credentials are correct → user is authenticated.
    >Authorization (What are you allowed to do?)
        .Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources an authenticated user is allowed to access.
            Example:
                .Admin can delete users
                .Student can view courses
                .Teacher can upload materials
