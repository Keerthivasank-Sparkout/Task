1.What is Git?
	> Git is Distributed version control system 
	> Used to track the changes in the source in code during software development.
	> It helps developer collaborate, manage different version of the code, and rollback to previous state if needed.
	
2.Core concepts of Git
	>Repositories(repo):
		Repo is a storage space where your project files and their history are kept. 
			There are two types of repository there,
				1.Local repository : A copy of the project on your local machine.
				2.Remote repository: A version of the project is hosted on a server,often a platform like Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket.
	>commit:
		>A commit  is a snapshot of your project  at a specific point in the time.
		>Each commit has unique identifier (hash)and message describing the change made.
		>Commit allow you to track and review the history of your project.
			Ways to Use the git commit Command:
				1.commit with message:
					git commit -m "commit with message"
					.Saved staged change with the provided message.
					.messages should be concise but descriptive.
				2.Commit All Changes at Once
					git commit -a -m "Update all tracked files"
					.Automatically stages modified and deleted tracked files before committing.
					.Note: Does not include untracked files-you still need git add for those.

				3. Amend Last Commit
					git commit --amend -m "Updated commit message"
					.Modify the last commit’s message or add new staged changes.
					.Useful for correcting mistakes in the most recent commit.
				4. Commit Interactively
					git commit -p
					.Allows you to commit changes hunk by hunk, giving fine-grained control over commits.
	>Branch:
		>Branches allow developers to work on separate tasks without affecting the main codebase. 
			Common branch types include:
			  .Main (or Master) Branch: The stable version of the project, usually production-ready.
			  . Feature Branch: Used for developing new features or bug fixes.

	>Merging:
		>Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. 
		>It allows you to combine the work done in different branches and resolve any conflicts that arise.
		
	>Cloning:
		>Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of a remote repository. This copy includes all files, branches, and commit history.
	
	>Pull and Push:
		>Pull: Fetches updates from the remote repository and integrates them into your local repository.
		>Push: Sends your local changes to the remote repository, making them available to others.
		
4.The Three States (The Staging Area)
	>In Git, your files can be in one of three main states. Understanding this is key to understanding how Git works:
		>Working Directory: This is your project folder with all the files you are currently working on. 
							Any changes you make here are not yet tracked by Git.
		>Staging Area (or Index): This is an intermediate area where you list the specific changes you want to include in your next "snapshot" or commit. 
								  You use the git add command to move changes from your working directory to the staging area.
		>Repository (.git directory): This is where Git permanently stores the snapshots (commits) of your project. 
									  You use the git commit command to save the staged changes into the repository.
									  
	This three-step process (modify -> add -> commit) gives you precise control over what gets saved in your project's history.

5.Basic Git Commands:
	.git status	- Shows the current status of the repository — staged, unstaged, and untracked files.
	.git add <file-name> - Stages a specific file for commit. Use git add . to stage all changes.
	.git commit -m "message" - Commits the staged changes with a descriptive commit message.
	.git commit -a -m "message" - commit without stageing(skip the git add <file name> commend).
	.git branch <branch-name> - Creates a new branch with the given name.
	.git checkout <branch-name>	- Switches to the specified branch.
	.git checkout -b <branch-name> - used to create new branch and switch the branch to newly created.
	.git switch <branch-name> - this also used to change the branch.(Alternate options).
	.git branch -d <branch-name> - used to delete the branch.
	.git push origin <branch-name> - used to push branch local repo to remote repo and create the new branch on the remote repo.
	.git merge <branch-name> - Merges changes from the given branch into the current branch.(if do merge check your branch is main).
	.git push origin <branch-name> - Pushes the local branch changes to the remote repository.
	.git pull origin <branch-name> - Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository into the local branch.
	.git log - Displays the commit history for the current branch.
	.git diff - used to track the changes in the code.
	.git diff --staged -used to track the changes in the code after the add file to stageing area.
	.git rm --cached <file name> - After we commit, if we want to delete the file git rm --cached <file name> comment is used tpo delete.
    .git stash -this comment is used to incase you working on the non priority project suddendly lead give priority work now your is not completed in that case use git stash to store the without commit and later finish it.
    .git stash --list - used to view the stash list.
    .git stash apply <stash id> - used to resume the work on the project. 
	
6. Github vs Gitlab vs Bitbucket:

    | Feature         | GitHub          | GitLab                | Bitbucket           |
    | --------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
    | Popularity      | Most popular    | Popular in DevOps     | Used in enterprise  |
    | CI/CD           | GitHub Actions  | Built-in strong CI/CD | Bitbucket Pipelines |
    | Used By         | Open source     | DevOps teams          | Atlassian users     |
    | Integrates With | Everything      | Kubernetes strong     | Jira, Trello        |
