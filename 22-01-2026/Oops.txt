1. What is Oops concepts?
	> OOPS -stands for Object Oriented Proramming
	> Oops is proagramming Paradigm based on the concept of the object that contain data(field)and behavior(method). 
	it focuses on desiging software that closely represent real world entities.
	> it improve the code reusability.
	> Enhance maintainability and scalability.
	> Make program easier and to understand and manage.
	> reference:https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_oop.asp

2. What is Purpose of the oops concepts?
	> Make a code more modular,
	> Easier to maintain.
	> Especially for complex applications, by using core concepts like 
		Encapsulation, 
		Inheritance, 
		Abstraction,
		and Polymorphism 
	  to manage complexity and improve readability.
	> It helps organize code logically, promoting code reuse and simplifying 
	  development by allowing objects to interact with each other without needing to know internal details.

3. What is class and object ?
	> Class and Object are two main aspects of object-oriented proagramming.
	> Class is a template for the object.
		Class Car{
		
		}
	> An object is instance of the class.
		Class Car{
			String model;
			String Brand;
			int Milage;
			void drive(){
				s.o.p("Driving...");
			}
			void break(){
				s.o.p("Stop the car...");
			}
		}
		class Main{
			p s v m(String [] args){
				Car obj_1 = new Car(); -- object is created.
				obj_1.model="xuv";
				obj_1.Brand="benz";
				obj_1.Milage=10;
				obj_1.drive();
				obj_1.break();
			}
		}
	>reference:https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_classes.asp

4. What is Constructors?
	> A constructor is a special method that is used to intilize objects.
	> The constructor is called when object of a class is created.
	> it can be used to set intial vlaues for object attributes.
	> the constructor name must same as the class name, and it can not return anything.
	>reference:https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_constructors.asp

5. What is (this) keyword?
	> The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.
	> The this keyword is often used to avoid confusion when class attributes have the same name as method or constructor parameters.
	> Sometimes a constructor or method has a parameter with the same name as a class variable. when this happens, the parameter temporarily hides the class variable inside that method or constructor.
		To refer to the class variable  and not the parameter, you can use the this keyword:
		class Main{
			int x;
			
			public Main(int x){
				this.x = x //this.x is refer to class variable 
			}
			public static void main(String [] args){
				Main obj=new Main(5);
				System.out.println(obj.x);
			}
		}
	> Think of this.x = x; as: "this.x (the class variable) gets the value of x (the parameter)."
	> Without this, the code above x = x; would set the parameter x equal to itself, and the class variable would stay uninitialized (0).
	> Calling a Constructor from Another Constructor
	> You can also use this() to call another constructor in the same class.
	> This is useful when you want to provide default values or reuse initializati on code instead of repeating it.
		public class Main {
			int modelYear;
			String modelName;
				// Constructor with one parameter
			public Main(String modelName) {
				// Call the two-parameter constructor to reuse code and set a default year    
				this(2020, modelName);
			 }
			  // Constructor with two parameters
			public Main(int modelYear, String modelName) {
				// Use 'this' to assign values to the class variables
				this.modelYear = modelYear;
				this.modelName = modelName;
			  }

			  // Method to print car information
			  public void printInfo() {
				System.out.println(modelYear + " " + modelName);
			  }

			  public static void main(String[] args) {
				// Create a car with only model name (uses default year)
				Main car1 = new Main("Corvette");

				// Create a car with both model year and name
				Main car2 = new Main(1969, "Mustang");

				car1.printInfo();
				car2.printInfo();
			  }
			}
	>reference:https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_this.asp
6. What is Access modifiers?
	> The access modifier meaning this is used to set the access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.
	> Its divide into two types
		> Access Modifiers -controls the access level.
		> Non-Access modifiers - do not control the access level, but provides other fuctionality.
	
	Access modifiers
	> Public - This code is accessible for all classes.
	> private - The code is only accessible within the declared class.
	> default - The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier.
	> protected - The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses.

	Non-Access modifiers
	> Non-access modifiers do not control visibility (like public or private), but instead add other features to classes, methods, and attributes.
	> The most commonly used non-access modifiers are final, static, and abstract.
	
	> final - Attributes and methods cannot be overridden/modified
	> static - Attributes and methods belong to the class, not to objects. This means all objects share the same static attribute, and static methods can be called without creating objects.
	> abstract - Can only be used in an abstract class, and can only be used on methods. The method does not have a body, for example abstract void run();. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
	>reference:https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_modifiers.asp

7. what is Encapsulation ?
	> Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods together and restricting direct access using private keyword.
	> Provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable.
	>reference:https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_encapsulation.asp

8. What is inheritance?
	> Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties and methods from another class by using extends keyword.
	> subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class.
	> superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from.
	> To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.
	>reference:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/object-oriented-programming-oops-concept-in-java/

9. What is Polymorphism?
	> This means one entity can take many forms. In Java, polymorphism allows the same method or object to behave differently based on the context.
		Types of Polymorphism:
			1.Method Overloading
			2.Method Overriding
		
		> Method Overloading:
			Also, known as compile-time polymorphism, is the concept of Polymorphism where more 
		  than one method share the same name with different signature(Parameters) in a class. 
		  The return type of these methods can or cannot be same.
		> Method Overriding:
			Also, known as run-time polymorphism, is the concept of Polymorphism where method in the child class has the same name, 
		  return-type and parameters as in parent class. The child class provides the implementation in the method already written.
	>reference:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/polymorphism-in-java/
	
10. What is super keyword?
	 > In java, the super keyword is used to refer the parent class of a subclass.
	 > The most common use of the super keyword is to eliminate the confusion between superclasses and subclasses that have methods with the same name.
		> It can be used in two main ways:
			To access attributes and methods from the parent class
			To call the parent class constructor
			
		> Access Parent Methods
			class Animal {
			  public void animalSound() {
				System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
			  }
			}

			class Dog extends Animal {
			  public void animalSound() {
				super.animalSound(); // Call the parent method
				System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");
			  }
			}

			public class Main {
			  public static void main(String[] args) {
				Dog myDog = new Dog();
				myDog.animalSound();
			  }
			}
		> Call Parent Constructor
			class Animal {
			  Animal() {
				System.out.println("Animal is created");
			  }
			}

			class Dog extends Animal {
			  Dog() {
				super(); // Call parent constructor
				System.out.println("Dog is created");
			  }
			}

			public class Main {
			  public static void main(String[] args) {
				Dog myDog = new Dog();
			  }
			}
	>reference:https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_super.asp

11. What is Abstraction?
	 > Data Abstraction  is the process of hiding certain details andd showing only essential information to the user.
	 > Abstraction can achieved with either abstract class or interfce.
	 > The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:
		> Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
		> Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
	 >reference:https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_abstract.asp

12. What is interface?
	 > Another way to achieve abstraction in Java, is with interfaces.
	 > An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies
	 > To access the interface methods, the interface must be "implemented" (kinda like inherited) by another class with 
	 the implements keyword (instead of extends). The body of the interface method is provided by the "implement" class:
