1.What is JavaScript?
    >JavaScript is a programming language mainly used to make websites interactive and dynamic.
        >Client side:
            .On the client side, JavaScript works along with HTML and CSS. 
            .HTML adds structure to a web page, CSS styles it, and JavaScript brings it to life by allowing users to inte
             ract with elements on the page, such as actions on clicking buttons, filling out forms, and showing animations. 
             JavaScript on the client side is directly executed in the user's browser.
        >server-side:
            .On the Server side (on Web Servers), JavaScript is used to access databases, file handling, and security features to send responses, to browsers.

2.what is variables?
    >A variable is like container that holds data that can be resued or updated later in the program.
     in javascript, variables are declared using the keywords var,let and const.

        1.var
            The var keyword is used to declare a variable. it has a function-scoped or globally-scopped behaviour.
            ex:
                fuction-scopped
                    if(true){
                        var x=10;
                    }
                    console.log(x) //output:10
                because it act global scoped value.

                var x=10;
                var x=15; 
                 its also possible its allow the re-declared.
        2.let
            the let keyword is introduced i  ES6, has block scope and cannot be re-declared in the same scope.
            ex:
                let n = 10 ; 
                n=20; // this can be allowed because only update the value
                let n=15; // this can not be allowed re-declare in same name.
                block scope:
                    if(true){

                        let x = 10;
                    }
                    console.log(x) // error
        3.const
            the const keyword declares variable that cannot be reassigned.its block scoped as well.
            ex:
                const n =100;
                n=200//throw error 

3.Data types?
    >a data type tells javascript what kind of value a variable is storing.
        there are two types:
            1.Primitive data type:
                .Number - represent the numberic values(integer and decimals)
                .String - represent the enclosed in single or double quotes.
                .Boolean -represent the logical value (true or false).
                .Undefined - A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value
                .Null - represent an intentional absence of any value.
                .Symbol - represent the unique and immutable values, often used as object.
                .bigInt - represent integer larger then Number.Max_safe_integer.
            2.Non-primitive data types:
                .object - represent key-value pairs 
                .array - represent an ordered list of values.
                .function - represent reusable block of code.
            
4.Javascript Operators:
    .Javascript operators are sysmbol or keywords used to perform operations on values and variables.
     they are the building block of javascript expressions and can manipulate data in various ways.
        >Arithmetic operator:
            const sum = 5+5;//addition
            const diff = 10-2;//subtraction
            const p=4*4;//multiplication
            const q=8/4;//division
        console.log(sum,diff,p,q);
    
        >Assignment operator:
            let n=10;
            n+=5;//add and assign
            n*=5;//multiply and assign
            n-=5;//subtract and assign
            n/=5;//divide and assign
        >Comparison operator:
            (>) check if the left value is greater than the right.
            (===) checks for strict equality(both type and value)
            (<) check if the left value is less than the right.
            (<=) check if the left value is less than or equal to the right.
            (>=) check if the left value is greater then or equal to the right.
            (!=) check if the left value is not equal to right.
        >Logical Operator:
            && - return true if both operands are true.
            || - return true if at least one operand is true.
            ! - negates the boolean value.
        >bitwise operator:
            & - perform a bitwise AND.
            | - perform a bitwise OR.
            ^ - perform a bitwise XOR.
            ~ - perform a bitwise NOT.
        >Ternary Operator:
            .it is shorthand for conditional statement.it takes three operands.
            .const age = 18;
            const result = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
            console.log(result) // output:adult.

            .(condition ? expression1 : expression2)
        >Relational Operator:
            (in) - checks if a property exists in an object.
            (instanceof) - checks if an object is an instance of a constructor.

5.Control statements:
    .Javascript control statement is used to control the execution of a program based on a specific condition.
     if the condition meets then a particular block of action will be executed otherwise it will execute another block of action that satisfies that particular condition.
        Types of control statement in javascript:
            1.conditional Statement:
                These statement are used for decision-making.
                    types:
                        1.if statement:
                            if(condition){
                                //if condition true block of code is excuted.
                            }
                        2.if-Else Statement:
                            if(condition){
                                //if condition is true if block executed.
                            }
                            else{
                                // if condition is false then else block is executed.
                            }
                        3.switch statement:
                            switch(expression){
                                case <value1>:
                                    statement1;
                                    break;
                                case <value2>:
                                    statement2;
                                    break;
                                default:
                                    statement default;
                            }
                2.iterative statement:
                    This is a statement that iterates repeatedly until a condition is met.
                        Types:
                            1.For loop:(when its know the how many times iteration want )
                                for(intailization;condition;increment/decrement){
                                    statement
                                }
                            2.while loop:(when its dont know the iteration count)
                                entry control loop 
                                instilization 
                                int i=0;
                                while(condition){
                                    statement;
                                    increment/decrement;
                                }
                            3.do-while loop:(when its want to execute atleast once go to do while)
                                exit control loop.
                                intailization;
                                do{
                                    statement;
                                    increment/decrement;
                                }while(condition);
            
6.Array
    An array is a data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable.
        let a = [10,"keerthi",{age:24},[10,20,30]];

        1.Adding elements to the array:
            push() - this method is used to add the element to the end of the array.
            ushift() - this method is used to add the element to the starting of the array.
            
            let a = ["HTML","CSS","JS"];
            a.push("REACT JS");
            a.unshift("NODE JS");
            console.log(a) // o/p : (NODE JS ,HTML,CSS,JS,REACT JS)
        2.Removing Element form the array:
            pop() - this method is used to remove an element from the last index of the array.
            shift() - this method is used to remove the element from the first index of the array.
            splice() - this method is used to remove or replace the element from the array.
            let a = ["HTML","CSS","JS","REACT","NODE","ANGULAR"];
            a.pop();
            a.shift();
            a.splice(2,2);
            console.log(a);//o/p:css,js,node;
        3.concat the two array:
            let a = [1,2,3,4,5];
            let b=[6,7,8,9,10];
            let c = a.concat(b);
            console.log(c);
        4.join method:
            let a = ["html","css","react",java]
            console.log(a.join('|')) o/p html|css|react|java  
        5.slice method:
            let a = ["html","css","react","java"]
            let b = a.slice(1,2)  o/p:css 
        6.map method:Transform each element
            let a1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            // let num =4
            let a2 = a1.map((a) => a*2 )
            console.log(a2)  //o/p:[ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]   
        7.filter method:Filter elements
            let a1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            // let num =4
            let a2 = a1.filter((a) => a>3 )
            console.log(a2)  //o/p:[ 4,5]
        8.reduce method:Reduce to single value
            let a1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            // let num =4
            let a2 = a1.reduce((a,b) => (a+b),0 )
            console.log(a2)  //o/p:15
        9.find method:Returns first matching element
            let a1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            // let num =4
            let a2 = a1.find((a) => a>2 )
            console.log(a2)  //o/p:3 
        10.includes method: – Checks if value exists                        
            let a1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            console.log(a1.includes(2))  //o/p:true 

7.Functions:
    Functions in javascript are reusable block of code designed to perform specific tasks, They allow you to organize,reuse,and modularize code.
    It can take inputs,perform action and retrun outputs.
    function greet(name){ // parameter 
        console.log("hello"+name);
    }
    greet("Keerthivasan" // argument passed)

    type of function:
        1.Name function
            function greet(){
                retrun "hello";
            }
            console.log(greet());
            Features:
                .Has a name (greet)
                .Hoisted (can call before declaration)
                .Reusable anywhere in its scope

        2.Anonymous function:
            const hello = function(){
                return "hello";
            }
            console.log(hello());
        3.Function Expression:
            const add=function(a,b){
                return a+b;
            }
            console.log(add(2,3));
            .Stored in variable
            .Not hoisted like declaration
            .Can be anonymous or named

        4.Arrow Function:
            const hello = ()=>{
                return "hello";
            }
            console.log(hello());
            .Short syntax
            .No own this
            .Not hoisted like normal functions
        5.callback function:
            function num(n,callback){
                return callback(n);
            }
            const  double = (n)=>n*2;
            console.log(num(5,double));

8.Asynchronous javascript:
    Asynchronous JavaScript allows long-running tasks to run in the background without blocking the main thread.
        There are several methods that can be used to perform asynchronous javascript tasks, which are listed below:
            1.using callback:
                Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to be executed after an asynchronous operation completes. 
                 They are used in asynchronous JavaScript to handle responses and ensure non-blocking execution,
                
            2.using Promises:
                Promises are objects representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, 
                providing better handling of asynchronous code with .then() and .catch().
            3.Async and Await
                Async/Await in JavaScript allows you to write asynchronous code in a clean, synchronous-like manner, making it easier to read, understand, and maintain while working with promises.
                    .async functions always return a Promise.
                    .await pauses execution until the Promise is resolved or rejected.
                    .Improves readability compared to .then() and .catch() chaining.
                    .Makes error handling simpler using try...catch.
                    .Ideal for managing complex asynchronous flows in a structured way.
