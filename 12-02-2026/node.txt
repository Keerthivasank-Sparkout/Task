1.what is v8 engine ?
    V8 is a JavaScript engine developed by Google that converts JavaScript code into machine code so your computer can execute it.
2.why v8 engine is fast?
    Node.js is fast because it uses Google’s V8 engine, which compiles JavaScript into optimized machine code using Just-In-Time compilation, along with efficient memory management and runtime optimization.
3.what is node js architecture?
    Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture powered by the V8 engine and libuv. The Event Loop manages asynchronous operations, allowing Node.js to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.
4.what is the Event loop?
    The Event Loop in Node.js is a core mechanism that manages asynchronous operations by continuously checking the call stack and callback queue, allowing non-blocking execution in a single-threaded environment.
5.What is Asynchronous Programming?
    In Node.js, asynchronous operations let your program do other work while waiting for tasks like file I/O or network requests to complete.
    This non-blocking approach enables Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.
6.File System
    1.creating file using node.
        -first need to import the fs(file system) using require
            const fs=require('fs');
        -create a folder using fs
            fs.mkdir('./docs',(err)=>{
                if(err){
                    console.log(err.message);
                }
                else{
                    console.log("file created");
                }
            })
            if already exists the same folder in that directory it can not create another insteed of throwing error and this is a asnychronous function
        -check already folder exists
            if(! existsSync('./docs',)){
                fs.mkdir('./docs',(err)=>{
                    if(err){
                        console.log(err.message);
                    }
                    else{
                        console.log("file created");
                    }
                })
            }
            if already file present existsSync() function return true so we use NOT opreator to prevent the creation.
        -create a file write the data inside the creting file
            fs.writeFile('./docs',"what do you need to wirte a inside file content",(err)=>{
                if(err){
                    console.log(err.message);
                }
                else{
                    console.log("File write successfully")
                }
            })
            if no file exist it create new and write a content, but if already file exits and content also exits it overwrite it.
        -Read the file using fs
            fs.readFile('./docs/text.txt',(err,data)=>{
                if(err){
                    console.log(err.message);
                }
                else{
                    console.log(data.toString());
                }
            })
        -delete the file using fs
            if(fs.existsSync('./docs/text/txt')){
                fs.unlink('./docs/text.txt',(err)=>{
                    if(err){
                        console.log(err.message);
                    }
                    else{
                        console.log("file deleted");
                    }
                })
            }
        -remove the directory using fs
            if(fs.existsSync('./docs')){
                fs.rmdir('./docs',(err)=>{
                    if(err){
                        console.log(err.message);
                    }
                    else{
                        console.log("folder removed successfully")
                    }
                })
            }   
        -A stream is a way to handle data piece by piece (chunk by chunk) instead of loading the whole data into memory at once.
            const readStream = fs.createReadStream('./docs/text.txt')

            readStream.on('data',(buffer)=>{
                console.log(buffer.toString());
            }) 
7.HTTP modules
    Node.js includes a powerful built-in HTTP module that enables you to create HTTP servers and make HTTP requests.
    This module is essential for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.
        Key Features
            .Create HTTP servers to handle requests and send responses
            .Make HTTP requests to other servers
            .Handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
            .Work with request and response headers
            .Handle streaming data for large payloads
    to use HTTP module, include it in your application using the require() method:
        const http = require('http');
    Create an HTTP server.
     the HTTP modules createServer() method creates an HTTP server that listen for request on a spicified port and excute a callback function for each request.
        const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{
            res.writeHead(200,{'content-Type' : 'text/plain'});
            res.end("hello world")
            console.log(req.url) // used to find find request from the url
            console.log(req.method) // used to find request from the method (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE)
        })

        server.listen(PORT,'localhost',()=>{
            console.log(`server running at port at http://localhost:${port}/`);
        })
        -http.createServer() - Creates a new HTTP server instance
        -The callback function is executed for each request with two parameters:
        -req - The request object (http.IncomingMessage)
        -res - The response object (http.ServerResponse)
        -res.writeHead() - Sets the response status code and headers
        -res.end() - Sends the response and ends the connection
        -server.listen() - Starts the server on the specified port
